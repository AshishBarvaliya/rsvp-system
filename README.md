## RSVP Management
This app creates a control panel where you can add, edit and remove guests.
You may connect this app to a database by storing the data in `this.state.guests` on `src/App.js`.
An implementation using Firebase is provided on the `firebase` branch.

### Usage
- Pull down code `git clone git@github.com:mmenavas/rsvp-management.git`
- Install dependencies `yarn install`
- Run site locally `yarn start`
- Prepare files for deployment `yarn build`

### TODO:
- Make client app for people to RSVP.
